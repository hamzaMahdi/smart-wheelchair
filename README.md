this repository hosts code for the smart wheelchair capstone project
In the “Smart Wheelchair” project, the traditional joystick is replaced with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which is placed on a wearable hat. The idea is to place the hat on the user’s head,  which will measure the roll, pitch, yaw angles of the head. The hat on the user's head is used as input to determine the desired velocity and steering direction of the wheelchair. Also, the “Smart Wheelchair” is equipped with a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor that enables obstacle detection and avoidance which increases the safety of both user and surroundings. The “Smart Wheelchair” aims to increase the user’s independence in terms of mobility. With the project being wholly modular and open source, it is easily transferable to any power wheelchair and can be replicated by anyone who has access to the documentation.
